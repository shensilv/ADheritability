# Testing runtime 

Here we test how the run-time of GCTA GREML varies with various factors, in order to decide which code submissions options to use when we run the full UKB analysis. In particular, we are interested in how the run-time scales with the number of individuals, the number of GRMs fitted in the analysis and the number of threads requested.
